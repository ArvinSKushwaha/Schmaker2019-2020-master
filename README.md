# Schmaker

Hello! This Schmaker is intended for use with NCSSM students! This repository contains all the code for the website. To use it, just type:

`python app.py`

into your terminal and go pull up the IP address provided in the terminal on your webbrowser of choice.

I will soon be updating this code, however, to be more easily updatable and robust for larger servers, perhaps switching the web framework to utilize Django instead of Flask.

I will also be rewriting the code to reduce it complexity to allow it to be more readable.
